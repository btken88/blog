# Display Basics With Flexbox

Being able to make elements of a page display where you want them to is an incredibly important aspect of the design and production of web apps. Back in the old days of the web, it wasn’t easy to play with how elements displayed relative to one another on a page - we had block elements and inline elements, and good luck getting them to do interesting things. Thankfully we’ve come a long way and introduced things like grid and flexbox which make our lives a lot easier.

## Display Block vs Inline

There are 2 main ways elements on the page are formatted for display - block and inline. Before getting into flexbox specifically, it’s important to understand the difference between these display types. As you can see below, block elements inherently take up the entire width of the container they’re in, forcing elements before and after onto new lines. Block elements can also be sized by giving specific values for the height and width.

But what's going on with those inline elements? The first thing to note is that Inline elements, however, take up only the space of their content and cannot be given width or height values.
